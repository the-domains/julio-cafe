description: 'In a quiet nook of Fitzroy North the outdoor seating at Julio offers classic street-side cafe lounging without a noseful of exhaust fumes or furiously late pedestrians spoiling your outlook. An espresso ($3) opens with rich malty notes and a syrupy mouthfeel and finishes with a robust acidity that speaks Italian, while a long macchiato ($3.50) might have a little too much crema for some but delivers on strength.'
